# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
The goal is to predict sales prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa with the help of 79 explanatory variables.

In 1_houses we build some simple baseline models and an initial XGBRegressor where we systematically add numerical, ordinal and categorical features.

In 2_houses we continue to work on the XGBRegressor and we study its feature importances. We start calling load_modules_files_functions_clean in order to load relevant modules and functions, and to perform basic data cleaning and feature engineering.

In 3_houses we try many different models (XGBRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor and LGBMRegressor) in order to see if we can get better performance. GradientBoostingRegressor is found to have the best performance.

In 4_houses we do more rigourous EDA and we work with the GradientBoostingRegressor. We try many different feature engineering idea.

In 5_houses we try out different kinds of categorical encodings.

In 6_houses we perform one final major hyperparameter optimization.
